A Ruby development plugin for Notepad++.
 
Features:
---------

* Auto-insert 'end' keywords after 'if', 'class', 'def', etc...
* Auto-insert closing array bracket (']') when '[' is typed.
* Execute a .rb script with a hotkey (<shift> + <ctrl> + y).
* Execute a single unit test method with a hotkey (<shift> + <ctrl> + t).

Requirements:
-------------

* Notepad++ (http://notepad-plus-plus.org/).
* .NET 2.0 or greater. (RubyWow is written in C# on .NET 2).

Installing RubyWow:
------------------

RubyWow requires these files be copied into Notepad++'s 'plugins' directory.
Both can be copied from the RubyWow directory:

https://github.com/rally25rs/npp-rubywow/tree/master/bin/Release

Copy the contents into:

{notepad++ install dir}\plugins\
                                RubyWow.dll
                                RubyWow\RubyWow.dll

These 2 .dlls have the same file name, but are different files.
One of them goes in a \RubyWow subdirectory.

Once installed, there will be a 'RubyWow' submenu in the Notepad++ 'Plugins' menu.

The first thing you should do is open the menu item
  Plugins | RubyWow | Settings...
In the Settings screen, set the path to the Ruby.exe executable.
This will enable RubyWow to run scripts and tests.
